# Cats vs Dogs vs Other

## Overview
Welcome to the Cats vs Dogs vs Other repository! This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project aimed at classifying images into three categories: cats, dogs, and other objects. The project utilizes a custom dataset comprising 30,000 images and employs reinforcement learning and computer vision techniques to identify and classify unseen images using a softmax classifier. Transfer learning techniques, leveraging models like AlexNet and ResNet, further enhance classification accuracy.
